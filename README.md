<h1> Images to PDF </h1>
This Python code takes images from a folder, sorts them alphabetically, and then creates a PDF file with them. It also adds page numbers to the images using the PyPDF2 library.
<h2> Usage </h2>
To use this code, first make sure that you have Python 3 and the PyPDF2 library installed on your computer. Then, place the images you want to include in a PDF in the "Images" folder. Finally, run "main.py" to generate the PDF file. 

Note that the images must be in JPEG format and have the ".jpg" file extension in order for the code to work properly. Additionally, the images will be sorted alphabetically by their file names, so make sure to name them in the order you want them to appear in the final PDF.
